# Simple firebase setup 
Just learning about how to setup firebase and how to work with it. 

Things that I did in this project-

1) Learnt about how to connect firebase with the ui interface & how to have track of the users.


2) Learnt about how to show information of the users that have logged in our application.


3) Learnt about how to implement the sign out functionality. 
## Screenshots
### The user interface will look something like this-

### After you press the button which reads "Google sign in" this window will pop up.

 ### After choosing your account, some information will be presented in the ui. You can also sign out just by pressing the sign out button.
